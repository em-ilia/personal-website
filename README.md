# welcome to my ~~video game channel~~ website
the part that's public, anyway

There's no backend component to my public website, so it's pretty much "open source" anyway—
you're downloading it if you open the page.
I wanted to use git to track it anyway, and GitHub is a pretty easy way to move files around.
(*just to be super clear—compromising my GitHub would not also imply compromising
my website*)
I mean, people who use GitHub pages for a personal website are essentially doing what I'm doing but
with fewer steps
(except I'm cooler because I have to manage nginx).
