## Recipe

The ingredients listed below are for roughly one tablespoon of mix,
which makes two fluid ounces of product.
Obviously, one should scale this recipe to produce the desired quantity of output.

<br />

### Notes

- A little bit of salt is probably good,
but I think there is a fair amount in the milk---be cautious here.

### Ingredients

- 1 g cocoa powder
- 3 g stevia
- 4 g powdered milk
- 44g water

### Procedure

1. Mix dry ingredients
2. Heat water
3. Add dry ingredients to water

### Price per 8oz glass

The prices below are sourced from a local chain grocery store, retrieved 20 July 2023.
In Pennsylvania, sales tax is not levied on non-prepared food items, such as those in this recipe.

| Item | Cost ($) | Mass (oz) | Mass (g) | $/g |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Cocoa | 4.49 | 8 | 227 | 0.0198 |
| Stevia | 5.99 | 9.8 | 278 | 0.0215 |
| Milk | 5.79 | 9.6 | 272 | 0.0213 |

From this table, we conclude that the price per gram is $0.0212
(a weighted average of the ingredients).

If we are to prepare an `8 oz` glass, we will require `4 Tbsp` of mix;
this is approximately `32 g` of mix.
Therefore our final cost is **$0.678**
(we assume the cost of water is negligible).
