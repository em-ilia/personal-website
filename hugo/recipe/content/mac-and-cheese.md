### Ingredients
- 1 tbsp flour
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup shredded cheese
- 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 8 oz (half box) dried macaroni

### Notes

- 1 cup of cheese means half of a block. Do not use an entire block or you will suffer.
- Sharper cheeses help the sauce to have flavor. Mild cheddar yields sub par flavor.
- Toast bread crumbs before baking them! They do not have the right texture otherwise.

### Procedure
1. Begin boiling water for pasta, begin cooking when boiling
2. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat
3. Add flour to butter and whisk immediately
4. Whisk until roux smells cooked
5. Add milk, continue whisking
6. When mixture thickens and begins to boil,
remove heat and add cheese
7. Continue stirring until all cheese is incorporated
8. Add Worcestershire sauce, and salt to taste
