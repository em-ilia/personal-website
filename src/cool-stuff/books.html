						I read the first Dune book without having seen the
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(1984_film)">Lynch film</a>
						and before the new movie was released.
						Unfortunately, I found that, in addition to the typical suspension of disbelief
						required by this genre, it was necessary to look past many <em>interesting</em>
						opinions Frank had regarding women (see: Heretics of Dune).

						<p class="book-entry__score"> 8 </p>
						<p class="book-entry__comments">
						Messiah is far more philosophical than Dune.
						Herbert's anti-theocracy and anti-autocracy messaging is far stronger here.
						One might say that Herbert's rejection of charismatically driven tyranny
						was prescient.

						<p class="book-entry__score"> 7.5 </p>
						<p class="book-entry__comments">
						In my mind, Children of Dune exists almost solely to set up its sequel.
						This book has some very uncomfortable moments
						(although by no means the worst this series has to offer)
						arising from Herbert's use of children characters with adult memories.

						A common criticism of GEoD is heavy use of monologue;
						I quite enjoyed the Worm's lengthy expositions.
						Philosophy aside, I enjoy this book for the absurdity of
						its premise:
						<span class=spoiler> a giant worm has near-complete control over

						<p class="book-entry__score"> 6.5 </p>

						How I adore Herbert's writing of women.
						There are many interesting ideas in Heretics,
						but this is in large part overshadowed by the more objectionable content.
						<span class=spoiler>
							As far as I can tell, Duncan is thirteen in this book.
							Fine, he reacquires his old memories, but the Bene Gesserit
							were planning to imprint him <em>before</em> that.
							The idea of imprinting is revolting on its own,
							but the pairing with an underage character is more so.

						<p class="book-entry__year"> 1984 </p>
						<p class="book-entry__score"> 7 </p>
						<p class="book-entry__comments">
						Although I found it hard to follow at times,
						Neuromancer's numerous contributions (if not outright creation of) to the genre
						cannot be dismissed.
						I found Gibson's writing of women characters to be lackluster;
						I personally can do without unexpected smut.
						The sequel, Count Zero, leaned this direction so quickly as to
						prompt my abandonment of the trilogy.
